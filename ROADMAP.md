## Backlog

### High Priority
- [ ] **Push notifications** - Alerts for ISS passes, meteor peaks, celestial events
- [ ] **Observation photos** - Attach images to observation logs
- [ ] **Share observations** - Export/share observation sessions

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Achievement system** - Badges for Messier marathon, planet collection, etc.
- [ ] **Observation streaks** - Track consecutive observation nights
- [ ] **Equipment profiles** - Save telescope/binocular specs for personalized recommendations
- [ ] **Sky chart integration** - Interactive star map with object positions

### Low Priority / Future Ideas
- [ ] **Social features** - Nearby observers, shared sightings
- [ ] **Aurora forecast** - Northern/Southern lights predictions
- [ ] **Satellite tracker** - Beyond ISS (Starlink, notable satellites)
- [ ] **Light pollution map** - Visual Bortle scale overlay
- [ ] **Astrophotography mode** - Exposure calculator, polar alignment helper
- [ ] **Widgets** - iOS/Android home screen widgets for next event

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add tests for TonightsBest component
- [ ] Add tests for theme cycling behavior
- [ ] Consider lazy-loading for less-used tabs
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (analyze with vite-bundle-visualizer)
